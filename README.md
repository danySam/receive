### Setup

Add systemd services for both staging and production environement using the following script and place it in `/etc/systemd/system` and name the file `receive.staging.service`

```
[Unit]

[Service]
Environment=NOMAD_INSTANCE=PROD
Environment=PORT=3000
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/lein run
Restart=always
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/opt/staging/receive

WantedBy=mutli-user.target
```

Run the following commands to start the service and enable auto restart

```
